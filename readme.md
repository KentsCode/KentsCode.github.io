# Kent's Profile Page
Hello. My name is Kenneth but feel free to call me Kent. I am a web developer with a passion for technology. I made this page to get my information out on the web and give talent scouts and hiring managers a place to find me and get my contact information as well as send me a message. The web page has links to some of my favorite projects. I invite you to check them out as well.

## Built with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap

## Future To Do's
I would like to more about making SVGs. I am working up some ideas in my head on how to incorporate them into this page as I learn more about them. 

Currently the message section utilizes a third party add on. I would like to set up an API on a server to handle the messaging.

I would like to incorporate my Google calendar (or other calendar app) into this page to allow users to request a time to speak with me.

Make the carousel in the top section 3D. This would be built from scratch instead of using the Owl Carousel plugin.
